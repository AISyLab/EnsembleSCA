Authors: Guilherme Perin (Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands), ≈Åukasz Chmielewski (Radboud University Nijmegen and Riscure BV) and Stjepan Picek (Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands)

## Datasets ##
The source code is prepared for three datasets: CHES CTF, ASCAD FIXED KEYS, ASCAD RANDOM KEYS.

### CHES CTF dataset ###
This dataset contains 45,000 profiling traces, with a fixed key, and additional 5,000 attacking traces with a different and fixed key. Each trace contains 2,200 samples that represent the processing of s-box operations around the first AES encryption round.

#### Download ####
CHES CTF dataset (ches_ctf.h5 file) can be downloaded from: https://www.dropbox.com/s/lpw1k3so99krmmq/ches_ctf.h5?dl=0

### ASCAD FIXED KEY dataset ###
